For this exercise, you should be able to manipulate HTML elements using CSS.
Suggested references: MDN is a generally good resource for CSS, but CSS Tricks is especially good for flexbox/grid layouts.

Rules:
Your work should be done in the stylesheet called style.css in this folder, unless otherwise stated.

All CSS changes should target things in the Challenge 2 work area - the CSS selector for this is section.challenge2, but most of the elements have classes anyway so you can just use the class names.

Feel free to request clarifications on what is being asked for, but if we're not being specific we will accept anything that accomplishes the stated objective.


Exercises:
1: 
- Change the background color of the work area to light gray (don't worry about the specific color)
- Change the font size of the work area to 1.5 times the normal font size without using px as a measurement
- Change the font family of the work area to Verdana, using sans-serif fonts as a fallback.

2. In the flexbox (className="flexbox"), make sure the spacing between elements is 24px.

3: Use inline styles with React to make the div element with a class name of "inline" have green text with a font weight of 800. Use inline styles for this task only.

4: Make the button with id "disabledStyledButton" have red text if it is disabled.

5: Add styles to the grid (div with class name "grid") such that the grid has 2 rows and 3 columns. Add some spacing between the rows and columns.

6: Make the form (div with class name "form") look as it does in the file "form.png" (which is in this folder).
