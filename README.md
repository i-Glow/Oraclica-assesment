Welcome to the Oraclica take-home interview! To get started, try running `npm install` once, then `npm start`.
(If that fails, search online how to install Node.js and npm.)
The instructions can be found on your webpage at `localhost:3000`, or in `src/App.tsx`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) if you want to know more.
